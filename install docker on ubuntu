Installation of Docker on Ubuntu

Step 1: Update package lists
Open a terminal window and run the following command to update the package lists on your Ubuntu system:

sudo apt update

Step 2: Install dependencies
Install the necessary dependencies for Docker by running the following command:

sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common

Step 3: Add Docker repository
Add the Docker repository to your system using the following command:

curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -

sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture)] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"

Step 4: Install Docker
Update your package lists again and then install Docker using the following commands:

sudo apt update

sudo apt install docker-ce

Step 5: Start and enable Docker
Start the Docker service and enable it to start on boot by running the following commands:

sudo systemctl start docker

sudo systemctl enable docker

Step 6: Verify Docker installation
You can verify that Docker is installed and running by running the following command:

sudo docker --version

This should display the version number of Docker if it is installed correctly.

That's it! Docker should now be installed on your Ubuntu system. You can start using Docker to create and manage containers for your applications.
